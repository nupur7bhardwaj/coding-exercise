        <p> I am trying to learn new things everyday.<br></br>
            It is QUITE a task to do some but some are more then easy to get through.
            I like when some challenge works in a go but get really tired when some
            take whole day and give pain in the head. I want to grow further and learn programming. 
            And my errors or mistakes day are my learnings and now I am not scared to face the challenges.
            I like my mentors and the way they help me while being so patient, sometimes I do such silly things 
            and still they smile and say politely what went wrong and how to correct again. </head>
